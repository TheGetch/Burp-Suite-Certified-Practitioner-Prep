# Burp-Suite-Certified-Practitioner-Prep
Materials used in preperation for the BSCP certification from PortSwigger

**All Lab Solutions.md**: Dump of (almost) all lab solutions from the Web Security Academy. Didn't include some real basic ones like some of the beginning XSS or SQLi labs.

**Exploit Server.md**: Payloads/code chunks used during labs. Creating this helped save time from typing everything out; I could just copy paste and update the appropriate URLs.

**Lab Solutions by Type.md**: Similiar to "All Lab Solutions.md", but categorized by the three stages of the exam: Initial Access, PrivX, System Access. I used this for if/when I got stuck, I would see which vunerability category I hadn't tried yet, or what exploit technique of a certain vulnerability category I didn't try yet.

**Methodology.md**: I created this to ensure I stayed on task and didn't get too far stuck or too far down rabbits holes. Almost all things listed to check for are straight from the labs/learning materials. Categorized by the three exam stages with the potential pages you may come across for each part.
